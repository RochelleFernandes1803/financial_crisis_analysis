# financial_crisis_analysis
In this project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on stock price data from various banks using Python. By analyzing historical stock price data, we gain insights into the performance and relationships of different banks' stocks.
# Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Data Retrieval: Fetching stock price data using pandas_datareader for the specified banks and time period.
2. Calculating Returns: Calculating the daily returns for each bank's stock.
3. Visualization: Creating visualizations to better understand the data, including line plots, pair plots, and distribution plots.
4. Moving Averages: Analyzing moving averages to identify trends in stock prices.
5. Correlation Analysis: Exploring the correlation between the closing prices of different bank stocks using heatmaps and clustermaps.
